[ActiveMQ Apollo](http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/) is a faster, more
reliable, easier to maintain messaging broker built from the foundations of
the original [ActiveMQ]((http://activemq.apache.org). It accomplishes this
using a radically different threading and message dispatching 
[architecture](documentation/architecture.html). 

In it’s current incarnation, Apollo only supports the STOMP protocol but just
like the original ActiveMQ, it’s been designed to be a multi protocol broker.
In future versions it should get OpenWire support so it can be compatible with
ActiveMQ 5.x JMS clients.
