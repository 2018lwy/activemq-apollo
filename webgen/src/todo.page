h2. Tasks
* InactivityMonitor needs to get inserted for OpenWire on the server side of MultiWireFormat negotiation.
* BIO SSL Transport does not currently pass Client Certificate chain in OpenWire ConnectionInfo command. This used to be done by the SSL transport but this shouldn't have OpenWire dependencies; instead protocol handler should be able to retrieve it from the underlying transport as needed.
