--- 

Overview
=============================

We are using [webgen](http://webgen.rubyforge.org/) for generating nice HTML based documentation.

Installing 
-----------------------------

You first need ruby and rubygems installed on your system.  Then you can 
install webgen with the following command

`sudo gem install webgen coderay feedtools haml`

Building 
-----------------------------

It's as simple as running `webgen` in the current directory.  Output is stored in 
the `out` directory.
